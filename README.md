## Test Mode
This app is a soft launch and will only be available until May 23, 2022.

## Overview
We are creating an application to help at-risk students succeed.

We take all the feedback by heart to make this important app.

## Cloud Launch

To view the WBCIVA app, go to the following url: https://share.streamlit.io/kiwibird97/usc-wbva/main/main.py

1. Click the green Code dropdown button, and then **Download ZIP**.
2. Open the folder in your code editor.
3. If you are using Visual Studio Code, you may need to trust the authors of the files first.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Open an integrated terminal, and type in the following code block:
